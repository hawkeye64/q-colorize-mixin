QColorizeMixin
===

QColorizeMixin is a Vue Mix-in library for components created with Quasar Framework. It is only for components that use a `render` function. It does not work with template formats found with SFC (single file components).

# Features

Allows you to "skin" your component with customized text, background and border colors. You can use:
1. any color from the [Quasar Color Palette](https://quasar.dev/style/color-palette#Color-List),
2. any # color (ex: `#c0c0c0`),
3. rgb/rgba/hsl/hsla color (ex: `rgb(255,0,0)`),
4. any css named colors (ex: `ghostwhite`) or
5. any Quasar colors from css var (ex: `--q-color-red-10`)
6. any Quasar colors as `border-` (ex: `border-blue-grey-10`)

This is a lot of choices!
